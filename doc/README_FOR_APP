## Cookies

Here is a rundown of the values stored in the user's cookie:

* `a (signed)`: User ID number, suitable for use with the YV API
* `b (signed)`: YouVersion username.
* `c (signed)`: YouVersion Password.
* `locale`: The shortcode for the user's locale, in the same format as the subdomain. This should be set when visiting any non-www domain, and should be read when visiting any www link. If a value isn't present when visiting www, set it to the default (en).
* `implicit_bible`: The user's most recent implicit Bible version. This means a version that the user was linked to in a note or something, or a version explicitly specified by a reading plan.
* `explicit_bible`: The user's most recent explicitly selected Bible version. Should be used when a version isn't mandated by the link or reading plan.
