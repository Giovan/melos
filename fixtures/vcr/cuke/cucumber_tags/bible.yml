    body: ! '{"response":{"code":200,"data":{"copyright":"<h3>Version Information<\/h3>\n\n<p>Why
      was <em>The Message<\/em> written? The best answer to that question comes from
      Eugene Peterson himself: \"While I was teaching a class on Galatians, I began
      to realize that the adults in my class weren''t feeling the vitality and directness
      that I sensed as I read and studied the New Testament in its original Greek.
      Writing straight from the original text, I began to attempt to bring into English
      the rhythms and idioms of the original language. I knew that the early readers
      of the New Testament were captured and engaged by these writings and I wanted
      my congregation to be impacted in the same way. I hoped to bring the New Testament
      to life for two different types of people: those who hadn''t read the Bible
      because it seemed too distant and irrelevant and those who had read the Bible
      so much that it had become ''old hat.''\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Peterson''s parishioners
      simply weren''t connecting with the real meaning of the words and the relevance
      of the New Testament for their own lives. So he began to bring into English
      the rhythms and idioms of the original ancient Greek&#151;writing straight out
      of the Greek text without looking at other English translations. As he shared
      his version of Galatians with them, they quit stirring their coffee and started
      catching Paul''s passion and excitement as he wrote to a group of Christians
      whom he was guiding in the ways of Jesus Christ. For more than two years, Peterson
      devoted all his efforts to <em>The Message New Testament<\/em>. His primary
      goal was to capture the tone of the text and the original conversational feel
      of the Greek, in contemporary English.<\/p>\n\n<p>Language changes. New words
      are formed. Old words take on new meaning. There is a need in every generation
      to keep the language of the gospel message current, fresh, and understandable&#151;the
      way it was for its very first readers. That is what <em>The Message<\/em> seeks
      to accomplish for contemporary readers. It is a version for our time&#151;designed
      to be read by contemporary people in the same way as the original <em> koine<\/em>
      Greek and Hebrew manuscripts were savored by people thousands of years ago.
      <\/p>\n\n<p>That''s why NavPress felt the time was right for a new version.
      When we hear something over and over again in the same way, we can become so
      familiar with it that the text loses its impact. The Message strives to help
      readers hear the living Word of God&#151;the Bible&#151;in a way that engages
      and intrigues us right where we are. <br><br>\n\n<p>Some people like to read
      the Bible in Elizabethan English. Others want to read a version that gives a
      close word-for-word correspondence between the original languages and English.
      Eugene Peterson recognized that the original sentence structure is very different
      from that of contemporary English. He decided to strive for the spirit of the
      original manuscripts&#151;to express the rhythm of the voices, the flavor of
      the idiomatic expressions, the subtle connotations of meaning that are often
      lost in English translations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of <em>The Message<\/em> is
      to engage people in the reading process and help them understand what they read.
      This is not a study Bible, but rather \"a reading Bible.\" The verse numbers,
      which are not in the original documents, have been left out of the print version
      to facilitate easy and enjoyable reading. The original books of the Bible were
      not written in formal language. <em>The Message<\/em> tries to recapture the
