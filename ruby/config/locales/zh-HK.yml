    faq question 1: "【互動】是什麽？"
    faq answer 1: "【互動】是 YouVersion 聖經軟件內置的一個功能，完全免費。它幫助用戶們輕而易舉地連繫他們所參加的教會活動。我們歡迎各地教會透過 events.bible.com 網頁登入事先註冊好的免費 YouVersion 帳戶來建立他們專屬的【互動】活動。成功發布的活動將會在聖經軟件裡顯現出來。我們提供免費的【互動】管理工具，方便你的教會分享重點、經文、圖像、外部連結、教會動態等資訊。 而且，你一旦將【互動】儲存在我們的系統裡，聖經軟件的用戶在搜尋他們附近教會的活動時，就能夠找到你的活動。"
    faq question 2: "有什麼好理由要我們的教會使用【互動】？"
    faq answer 2: "Events empowers you to offer services to your attenders that directly support your ministry objectives. The notes, Bible references, and other supporting information that you include in your Events helps your attenders connect more with your message. Events helps your audiences retain your messages for personal reflection, while at the same time equipping them to share the special things happening at your church. Events helps seekers find you, and it saves you money by helping you cut communication printing costs. And Events is completely free."
    faq question 3: "Why would Bible App users want to use Events?"
    faq answer 3: "Events helps users discover church events happening near them using the geo-location features of their device. When users attend one of your Events, they’ll be able to easily follow along with your service by viewing the information that you’ve provided. Bible App users can add their own notes to an Event on their device, and even save a copy for future reference, both of which will encourage them to engage more with the Bible."
    faq question 4: "How can I create a poll?"
    faq answer 4: "Use a third party tool or service (such as <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/'>SurveyMonkey®</a>, <a href='http://www.pollsnack.com/'>PollSnack</a>, or <a href='http://www.poll-maker.com/'>Poll Maker</a>) to create your poll. When you save your poll, the service will provide you with a shareable link for it. In the Events admin tool, drag-and-drop a Web Links Module into your Event where you want your poll to appear, and include the poll link there."
    faq question 5: "我們以前用 YouVersion【現場】功能所建立的活動會自動轉換到新的【互動】平臺上嗎？"
    faq answer 5: "Sorry, but no. To create the best Events experience possible — both for you and for your attenders — we had to build Events from the ground up. Consequently, data from Live is not transferable to Events."
    faq question 6: "What if our attenders don’t update their Bible App? Will they be able to see the new Events we create?"
    faq answer 6: "由於【互動】是項全新的功能，用戶必須用更新版聖經軟件才能夠使用。（還好，許多聖經軟件用戶已將他們的設備設定為自動更新的模式。）當用戶點擊【現場】的標籤時，一項【現場】活動會顯示出一則訊息，推薦用戶要更新軟件才能使用【互動】功能。為了讓固定參與你聚會的人熟悉【互動】，我們建議你利用聚會中報告消息的時間，向他們簡單介紹你的教會如何使用這項功能。幫助你的會眾了解【互動】的好處，並且讓他們知道獲取它的方式。"
    faq question 7: "Live has always been free. Will Events cost anything?"
    faq answer 7: "不需要。聖經軟件一向是免費的，而且永遠是免費的。【互動】雖然是一項全新服務，卻仍屬聖經軟件内置的必備功能之一。能協助達成你的事工目標，我們 YouVersion 全體同工深感榮幸。"
    faq question 8: "Does Events require a special Administrator account to use?"
    faq answer 8: "雖然在操作方面，你可以使用你的 YouVersion 個人帳戶建立【互動】活動，但我們建議你的教會或機構設定一個獨立帳戶，專門作為活動管理之用。這個建議有雙重的目的：一來可以把聖經軟件裡的個人帳戶與事工任務區分出來；二則可以讓其他人，如教會工作人員或可信賴的義工，參與你事工的【互動】管理。（如果你的事工已有一個管理專用的 YouVersion 帳戶——如為舊版 YouVersion【現場】功能所建立的帳戶——那麽你可以使用同一帳戶登入新的【互動】管理網站。）"
    spread the word: "輕輕鬆鬆宣傳你的【互動】活動。"
    resources intro: "你一旦設定了【互動】的時間，並準備好要將它分享出去，【互動】會提供你連結讓你可以用在你所有的社交媒體、電郵傳送，甚至是聚會或活動進行所使用的展示螢幕上。擁有聖經軟件的人只要點擊了你的連結，你的【互動】活動會立即呈現在聖經軟件裡。沒有聖經軟件的人則可以在 Bible.com 上看見你的【互動】，在那裡他們會有機會可以安裝聖經軟件。"

    relevancy copy: "In generations past, the access people had to the Bible was very limited. Today, this is no longer the case. However, many people who have access to the Bible think its message does not apply to their lives. At the same time, there are others who believe there is a connection between the Bible and their every day experiences."

    information revolution copy: "Over the last decade, the Internet has brought about a revolution which empowers people like never before. With the ability to share, contribute, create, broadcast and communicate, it's easy to express who we are and what we believe with the rest of the world."
    youversion copy: "Since its start in 1996, Life.Church's purpose has been to lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. In doing so, we have looked for new ways to help people connect the Bible to their daily lives. Our methods have changed over the years as we've incorporated various technologies and strategies. But at the core, our focus remains on relevancy as we consistently strive to demonstrate and teach people how God's Word relates to everyone, no matter where they are in life."
