      p46: "Our ability to provide different versions of the Bible in different languages is a result of and subject to agreements among us and certain Bible societies and publishers, which we’ll call “YouVersion Content Providers.” YouVersion Content Provider agreements allow us to provide YouVersion users the ability to download certain Bible text for offline use on the condition that we provide YouVersion Content Providers the user’s name, email address, and country for future communications. As a result, in order to provide this optional functionality, we must provide your name, email address and country to the pertinent YouVersion Content Provider, which may contact you for other purposes. We only share this information with the YouVersion Content Provider for the offline version you request, we do so on a confidential basis, and only if the YouVersion Content Provider agrees to keep the information we share about you confidential. No other personal information of yours will be shared with any YouVersion Content Providers. When you choose to download a version for offline use, you will receive a prompt as a reminder of these terms, which you must agree to at that time in order to continue with your download.

We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity, if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose. In any case, where we provide information access, deletion or correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort."
      p49: "If you choose to close your account or ask that we modify or delete some or all of your personal information, we will retain your personal data if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our <a href=\"https://www.bible.com/terms\">Terms of Use</a> or fulfill any others requests from you (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy of your data)."

Unless you have included personally-identifiable information in content created with this functionality (such as a personal image or address or first and last name), content created with this functionality is not considered personal data by Life.Church, as it generally concerns Bible text and content and not any one user specifically. As a result, Life.Church reserves the right to maintain this information, including inferences made with this information after deletion of an account. For example, while we will delete your email address if your account is deleted, we will maintain and reserve the right to use and share what Bible verses were shared, highlighted, etc. by you in a manner that does not identify you personally. We will also retain our aggregate count of the number to total YouVersion applications downloaded which would include the fact of you downloading YouVersion without maintaining personal information associated with that account."
