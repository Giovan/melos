      p23: "YouVersion을 사용하기 위해 YouVersion 회원이 될 필요는 없습니다. 그러나 회원 자격을 통해 저희는 YouVersion을 보다 개인화 경험으로 맞춰 드릴 수 있습니다. 회원이 되려면 계정을 만들고 이름 및 이메일 주소와 같은 특정 정보를 제공 해야하며, 해당 정보는 귀하의 회원 계정과 연결됩니다."
      p24: "이 필수 정보 외에도 귀하의 회원 계정과 관련된 추가 정보를 제공할지 여부를 선택할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 개인 데이터를 YouVersion에 제공, 게시 또는 업로드 할 때 우리는 귀하로부터 그 데이터를 수집하게 됩니다. 귀하가 그러한 정보를 반드시 제공 할 필요는 없습니다만, 그렇게하지 않을 경우, 저희가 YouVersion을 개인화하기 어렵고 귀하가 YouVersion을 완전하게 사용하기 어려울 수 있습니다."
      p25: "귀하가 다른 웹 사이트, 어플리케이션 및 서비스 또는 다른 업체의 어플리케이션들에 연결된 프로필을 YouVersion과 링크하기로 선택하면, 귀하는 해당 어플리케이션에 저장된 개인 데이터를 YouVersion 및 Life.Church에 제공하게 됩니다. 예를 들어, Facebook 계정을 YouVersion에 링크하고 Facebook을 통해 Life.Church에 개인 정보를 공유하도록 선택하면 새로운 YouVersion 회원 자격 계정을 시작할 수 있습니다. 해당 응용 프로그램의 설정을 변경하여 그러한 계정 및 다른 어플리케이션과의 링크를 취소 할 수 있습니다. 또한 친구에게 추천하거나, 연락처 가입 알림을 받거나 또는 YouVersion 초대장을 보내기 위해서 귀하의 장치에 입력된 연락처에 대한 접근 권한을 부여하면 귀하에게 해당 기능을 제공하기 위해 저희의 서버에 해당 정보가 저장됩니다."
      h20: "Sensitive Data"
      p26: "By downloading and using YouVersion, we do not assume that you are of any particular religious denomination or are expressing to us any particular religious belief; we merely assume that you are interested in the Bible. We do not require that users provide such beliefs to us or provide any other sensitive data such as race, ethnicity, philosophical beliefs, or physical or mental health to create or maintain a YouVersion Member account. It is your choice whether to provide such sensitive information should it be an option to do so. If you choose to provide any sensitive information, it may be used by Life.Church to create a more personalized YouVersion experience like other non-sensitive information you provide. In any event, Life.Church will only process sensitive data you provide to us for Life.Church’s legitimate activities on your behalf and will not disclose this information without your express consent. We will maintain your information subject to appropriate safeguards discussed in this policy and otherwise provided by Life.Church.

      h22: "Your Posts and Contributions."
      p28: "When YouVersion allows you to provide information to be published, distributed, or displayed, we refer to that as “posted,” which can be on public areas of YouVersion, websites you access through YouVersion or transmitted to other users of YouVersion or third parties, all of which we’ll call “User Contributions.” For example, these include activities such as creating a Note, making a comment on a friend’s post, or creating a Verse Image."
      p29: "Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in a public manner whether through collaborative postings, social media, message boards, or other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. User Contributions are posted and transmitted at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users or third parties with whom you choose to share your User Contributions.

They also help us ensure that Member information is used in association with the correct Member account. Importantly, we do not use cookies or similar technologies to facilitate interest-based ads from third parties."
      p32: "Although most internet browsers accept cookies and the like by default, you can control these types of technology through your browser settings and similar tools and agree to refuse all cookies altogether. If you refuse to accept cookies and similar technologies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or smartphone, you may be unable to access certain parts of YouVersion, prohibiting us from delivering the full capability of YouVersion and preventing the use of certain features and services that require these technologies."
      p33: "By agreeing to our Privacy Policy, you agree to the use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this policy. If you use YouVersion without changing your browser or device settings to disable cookies, we'll assume that you consent to receive all cookies provided through YouVersion."
      p34: "<strong>Device ID and Location.</strong> When you access or leave YouVersion, we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to next.

      p38: "<strong>Personal Information.</strong> We may tie information we do collect automatically as described above to personal information you provide to us to tailor YouVersion to you and make suggestions about YouVersion services and functionality as described above. Life.Church is consistently seeking new and improved ways to offer YouVersion and increase Bible engagement. As we improve YouVersion, this may mean the collection of new data or new ways to use data. Because YouVersion is dynamic, and we continuously seek to offer new features, we may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy."
      h24: "Third-party Information Collection"
      p39: "This Privacy Policy applies only to sites and apps that are owned and operated by Life.Church. Please keep in mind that YouVersion may contain links to other websites or apps. You are responsible for reviewing the privacy statements and policies of those other websites you choose to link to or from YouVersion, so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and store your information. We are not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or content of other websites or apps, including websites you link to or from YouVersion. Websites containing co-branding (referencing our name and a third party’s name) contain content delivered by the third party and not us."
      p40: "Life.Church cannot regulate other sites, content, or applications linked or provided from within YouVersion and our various web sites and services. Some content or applications, including partner offers, on or in YouVersion may be served by third-parties, including content providers, application providers, analytics companies, your mobile device manufacturer, and your mobile service provider. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites, apps, and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) targeted content. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used.

      h27: "Disclosure by You"
      p42: "When you share information through YouVersion, that information is viewable by you and by anyone else you chose to share it with. If you give access to your YouVersion account to other applications and services, based on your approval, those services would then have access to your shared information. The use, collection and protection of your data by such third party services is subject to those third parties’ policies."
      h28: "Internal Disclosure"
      p43: "We will share your personal data internally within Life.Church to help combine the personal information covered across the different aspects of YouVersion and our other products and services to help provide services to you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and others.

      h29: "Disclosure to Our Service Providers"
      p44: "We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to contractors, service providers and other third parties we use solely to support our mission (such as cloud hosting, maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, communication, and development). For example, some of the YouVersion platforms used to send emails and notifications are built and managed by third parties, so some of your information is sent securely to those services to provide such functionality. They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes."
      h30: "Legal Process"
      p45: "It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of YouVersion; or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Life.Church, our Members and/or Visitors, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand."
      h31: "YouVersion Content Providers"
      p46: "Our ability to provide different versions of the Bible in different languages is a result of and subject to agreements among us and certain Bible societies and publishers, which we’ll call “YouVersion Content Providers.” YouVersion Content Provider agreements allow us to provide YouVersion users the ability to download certain Bible text for offline use on the condition that we provide YouVersion Content Providers the user’s name, email address, and country for future communications. As a result, in order to provide this optional functionality, we must provide your name, email address and country to the pertinent YouVersion Content Provider, which may contact you for other purposes. We only share this information with the YouVersion Content Provider for the offline version you request, we do so on a confidential basis, and only if the YouVersion Content Provider agrees to keep the information we share about you confidential. No other personal information of yours will be shared with any YouVersion Content Providers. When you choose to download a version for offline use, you will receive a prompt as a reminder of these terms, which you must agree to at that time in order to continue with your download. No information will be shared until you grant approval, which will then give you access to download that offline version. Your interactions with any YouVersion Content Providers is solely among you and that YouVersion Content Provider."
      h32: "Your Rights to Deleting, Accessing and Correcting Your Information"
      p47: "For personal data that we have about you, you have the following rights:"
      l5-1: "Deletion. You may ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data. Please note that doing so may limit your ability to use certain functionality of YouVersion. Please note that an email address is required to have a Member account."
      l5-2: "Correction/Modification: You may edit some of your personal data through your account or ask us to change, update, or fix your data in certain cases, including if it’s inaccurate."
      l5-3: "Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (for example, if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (for example, if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held)."
      l5-4: "Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You can ask us for a copy of your personal data you provided to us."
      p48: "To make these or any other requests with respect to your personal information, you may send us an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:help@youversion.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy\">help@youversion.com</a>. You may also contact us at: Life Covenant Church, Inc., attn.: YouVersion Support, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma 73034. We ask that individuals making requests identify themselves and identify the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before we process any requests. We may decline to process requests if we cannot verify the requestor's identity, if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose. In any case, where we provide information access, deletion or correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort."
      p49: "If you choose to close your account or ask that we modify or delete some or all of your personal information, we will retain your personal data if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our <a href=\"https://www.bible.com/terms\">Terms of Use</a> or fulfill any others requests from you (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy of your data)."
      p50: "Use of YouVersion includes several functions, including selection of Bible reading plans, creating scripture bookmarks, highlighting certain portions of scripture, creating notes and moments concerning scripture, searching the Bible based on an emoji or keyword, saving and sharing certain verses and creating images from certain Biblical text. Unless you have included personally-identifiable information in content created with this functionality (such as a personal image or address or first and last name), content created with this functionality is not considered personal data by Life.Church, as it generally concerns Bible text and content and not any one user specifically. As a result, Life.Church reserves the right to maintain this information, including inferences made with this information after deletion of an account. For example, while we will delete your email address if your account is deleted, we will maintain and reserve the right to use and share what Bible verses were shared, highlighted, etc. by you in a manner that does not identify you personally. We will also retain our aggregate count of the number to total YouVersion applications downloaded which would include the fact of you downloading YouVersion without maintaining personal information associated with that account."
      p51: "We have no control of information you have shared with others through YouVersion after you close your account or asked to delete information or attempted to delete your account yourself.
