    faq question 1: "कार्यक्रमहरू भनेको के हो?"
    faq answer 1: "Events is a completely free feature inside the YouVersion Bible App that helps users easily connect with church events they’re attending. Churches are welcome to sign in at events.bible.com with a free YouVersion account to create their own Events to appear in the Bible App. The free administrative tools for Events make it easy for your church to share key message points, Bible references, artwork, external links, important church news, and more. And, once you save your Event in the system, Bible App users looking for events near them will be able to find yours."
    faq question 2: "हाम्रा चर्चले कार्यक्रमहरू किन प्रयोग गर्न खोज्छन? "
    faq answer 2: "Events empowers you to offer services to your attenders that directly support your ministry objectives. The notes, Bible references, and other supporting information that you include in your Events helps your attenders connect more with your message. Events helps your audiences retain your messages for personal reflection, while at the same time equipping them to share the special things happening at your church. Events helps seekers find you, and it saves you money by helping you cut communication printing costs. And Events is completely free."
    faq question 3: "बाइबल एप प्रयोगकर्ताहरूले किन कार्यक्रम को प्रयोग गर्न चाहन्छन्? "
    faq answer 3: "Events helps users discover church events happening near them using the geo-location features of their device. When users attend one of your Events, they’ll be able to easily follow along with your service by viewing the information that you’ve provided. Bible App users can add their own notes to an Event on their device, and even save a copy for future reference, both of which will encourage them to engage more with the Bible."
    faq question 4: "म कसरी सर्वेक्षण सृजना गर्न सक्छु?"
    faq answer 4: "Use a third party tool or service (such as <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/'>SurveyMonkey®</a>, <a href='http://www.pollsnack.com/'>PollSnack</a>, or <a href='http://www.poll-maker.com/'>Poll Maker</a>) to create your poll. When you save your poll, the service will provide you with a shareable link for it. In the Events admin tool, drag-and-drop a Web Links Module into your Event where you want your poll to appear, and include the poll link there."
    faq question 5: "Will events that we created on YouVersion Live automatically transition to the new Events platform?"
    faq answer 5: "Sorry, but no. To create the best Events experience possible — both for you and for your attenders — we had to build Events from the ground up. Consequently, data from Live is not transferable to Events."
    faq question 6: "What if our attenders don’t update their Bible App? Will they be able to see the new Events we create?"
    faq answer 6: "Because Events is an all-new app feature, users must update their Bible App to get it. (Fortunately, many Bible App users already have their devices set to auto-update.) When a user taps on the Live tab, a single Live event displays a message recommending that they update so that they can take advantage of Events. Until your regular attenders become accustomed to Events, we suggest that you explain briefly during your announcement time how your church is using it. Help your audience understand how it benefits them, and let them know how they can get it."
    faq question 7: "लाइभ संधै नि:शुल्क छ। कार्यक्रमको निम्ति कुनै मूल्य तिर्नु पर्छ? "
    faq answer 7: "No. The Bible App has always been free, and it always will be. Although Events is an all-new service, it’s an integral part of the Bible App. At YouVersion, we consider it our honor and privilege to be able to help you fulfill your ministry objectives."
    faq question 8: "के कार्यक्रमको प्रयोग गर्न कुनै एडमिनिष्ट्रेटरको एकाउन्ट चाहिन्छ? "
    faq answer 8: "While technically you can use your personal YouVersion account to create Events, we recommend instead that you maintain a separate account for your organization, one set aside specifically for administrative purposes. This approach serves two purposes: (1) it lets you keep your personal Bible App use separate from your ministry tasks, and (2) it allows you to empower others to manage Events for your ministry, such as other staff members or trusted volunteers. (If your ministry already has a YouVersion account designated for administrative tasks — such as for the older YouVersion Live — you’ll be able to use that same account to sign in to the new Events administrative site.)"
    spread the word: "Spread the word about your Event, easily."
    resources intro: "Once you have your Event scheduled and ready to share, Events gives you a link you can use on all your social networks, in your email communications, and even on screen during your service or event. When someone with the Bible App visits your link, your Event opens directly inside the app. If they don’t have the Bible App, they’ll see your Event at Bible.com, with options to get the app if they want it."

    relevancy copy: "In generations past, the access people had to the Bible was very limited. Today, this is no longer the case. However, many people who have access to the Bible think its message does not apply to their lives. At the same time, there are others who believe there is a connection between the Bible and their every day experiences."

    information revolution copy: "Over the last decade, the Internet has brought about a revolution which empowers people like never before. With the ability to share, contribute, create, broadcast and communicate, it's easy to express who we are and what we believe with the rest of the world."
    youversion copy: "Since its start in 1996, Life.Church's purpose has been to lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. In doing so, we have looked for new ways to help people connect the Bible to their daily lives. Our methods have changed over the years as we've incorporated various technologies and strategies. But at the core, our focus remains on relevancy as we consistently strive to demonstrate and teach people how God's Word relates to everyone, no matter where they are in life."
