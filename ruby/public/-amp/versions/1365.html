<h1>Metrical Psalms 1650 (MP1650)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>English</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p> A metrical Psalter is a version of the Psalms, which is translated into metre and rhyme, to enable the Psalms to be sung to standard tunes during Christian worship. The earliest English metrical Psalms were produced in Geneva by English speaking Protestant exiles in the 16th century. The 3rd edition of the Anglo-Genevan Psalter included 87 psalms.  John Knox brought this tradition back to Scotland. In 1562 the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland directed that a Psalter be completed.  The first complete metrical Psalter was produced in 1564. This was revised by the Englishman Francis Rous in 1641, and it was based on the language of the King James Version of the Bible. The Westminster Assembly submitted this to further revision. This was further revised, and the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland authorised the 1650 edition for public worship, and it was used by Presbyterians throughout the United Kingdom and beyond. In Scotland editions of the Authorised King James Version (KJV) of the Bible were often printed with the Metrical Psalter at the back.  <br/><br/>Psalm singing has been a feature of public Christian worship since the Reformation. Many of the metrical Psalms, especially Psalm 23 and Psalm 100, are hymns found in the hymnals of many denominations. "The Psalms of David in Metre" are part of the common heritage of the English speaking Church. Most of the Psalms in the Psalter are in the 8,6,8,6 common metre. A small number of psalms have 2 alternatives and the first is listed in this version. <br/><br/>This translation, was first published in 1650.  If you are interested in the work of the Bible Society, please contact the British and Foreign Bible Society at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biblesociety.org.uk">www.biblesociety.org.uk</a><br/><br/></p>
