It is a Gaelic language related to Irish (Gaeilge) and Scots Gaelic (Gàidhlig) but with its own orthography closer to English style spelling. The last few years have seen a remarkable increase in interest in the Manx language. Digitised Scripture resources have been produced by the Bible Society with language support from Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh (the Manx Language Society) and Culture Vannin, to help the growing number of Manx speakers engage with the Bible. </p> <p> <strong>The Bible in Manx</strong> </p> <p>The first part of the Bible in Manx to be published was the Gospel of Matthew (Noo Mian) was printed in 1748. Later the whole Bible was translated into Manx by a committee of 23 Manx clergymen under the direction of the Anglican Bishop of Sodor and Mann. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) published the Manx New Testament (Conaant Noa) in 1767. The whole Manx Bible was then first published as Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) in 3 volumes. The first part of the Old Testament was published as Volume 1 in 1771. The second half of the Old Testament (including 2 books of Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus from the Apocrypha) were completed in 1772 and published as Volume 2 in 1773. The New Testament was published as Volume 3 in 1773. The whole Bible was published as one volume for the first time in 1775. Its bicentenary was celebrated in 1975. The Bible was translated from Hebrew and Greek with reference to the King James Version of the Bible, with the proper names and some technical words following the English King James Version of the Bible.</p> <p> <strong>Bible Society editions</strong> </p> <p>The British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) was formed in 1804. BFBS published the SPCK New Testament in 1808, again in 1815, and then the whole Bible, excluding footnotes and excluding the Apocrypha, in 1810. The last revision of the whole Bible was printed in 1819. In 1824 BFBS reprinted the New Testament. BFBS reprinted the 1819 Gospel of John (Noo Ean) in 1936, and this was reprinted by the Manx Gaelic Society in 1968. The whole 1819 Bible Society edition of the Manx Bible was reprinted by Shearwater Press in 1979.</p> <p> <strong>Digital Edition</strong> </p> <p>This translation was digitised by British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) from their archives with the help of MissionAssist in 2017.</p> <p>© British and Foreign Bible Society 1819, 2017</p>
