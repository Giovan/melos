<h1>The Passion Translation (TPT)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>English</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<h1>About the Passion Translation</h1> <p>The purpose of the Passion Translation is to reintroduce the passion and fire of the Bible to the English reader. It doesn’t merely convey the literal meaning of words. It expresses God’s passion for people and his world by translating the original, life-changing message of God’s Word for modern readers.</p> <p>You will notice at times we’ve italicized certain words or phrases. These highlighted portions are not in the original Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic manuscripts but are implied from the context. We’ve made these implications explicit for the sake of narrative clarity and to better convey the meaning of God’s Word. This is a common practice by mainstream translations.</p> <p>We’ve also chosen to translate certain names in their original Hebrew or Greek form to better convey their cultural meaning and significance. For instance, some translations of the Bible have substituted Jacob with James and Judah with Jude. Both Greek and Aramaic leave these Hebrew names in their original form. Therefore, this translation uses those cultural names.</p> <p>God longs to have his Word expressed in every language in a way that would unlock the passion of his heart. Our goal is to trigger inside every English-speaking reader an overwhelming response to the truth of the Bible. This is a heart-level translation, from the passion of God’s heart to the passion of your heart.</p> <p>We pray this version of God’s Word will kindle in you a burning desire for him and his heart, while impacting the church for years to come.</p> <p>Please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://thePassionTranslation.com">thePassionTranslation.com</a> for more information about the Passion Translation.</p> <h1>Copyright</h1> <p>The Passion Translation® Copyright © 2017 by Passion & Fire Ministries, Inc.
