<h1>Ao Naga Bible 2010 (ANB10)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>Ao Naga</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p>Ao Nagas are found in the north-eastern part of Nagaland, mostly in the central Mokokchung District and also few are found in the adjacent Assam state. Mokokchung, one of the districts in Nagaland, is considered as the home of the Ao Naga tribe. The physiography of the district shows six distinct hill ranges which are more or less parallel to each other and run in the south-east direction.The Ao Naga tribes of Nagaland speak three languages: Chungli, Mongsen, and Changki. Chungli Ao and Mongsen Ao are spoken in majority of the Ao villages whereas Changki speakers form the minor speakers.During the American Baptist Mission to Naga Hills in 1872, Dr E.W.Clark first came in contact with the Molungkimong village that paved the way for a common Ao language, the Chungli Ao. </p> <p>The literacy work between the Ao and other Naga peoples was initiated only after the advent of the Christian missionaries from America in 1872. The spread of the gospel among the Naga peoples encouraged the writing of the hitherto unwritten languages. The missionaries who served these peoples developed script systems for most of the Naga languages. This is how the Bible translation work in Ao Naga was started. The missionaries began with the translated portions of the New Testament and the complete New Testament was published in 1929. This laid down a milestone for the Ao Nagas and the growth of the churches was seen evidently. Decades after the publication of the New Testament the translation on the Old Testament was launched through the Bible Society of India and the first complete Bible in Ao Naga was published in the year 1964. This was a historic moment for the Church and the Ao Nagas, the first Nagas to have a complete Bible was indeed considered as God’s Blessings. The release of the Holy Bible in Ao Naga not only nourished the Ao people spiritually it also helped the growth of the language in significant ways. Ao language writers started writing their language using the diction, styles, grammar and spellings used in the Bible translation. Teachers in Ao schools set their standards by the language used in the Bible. In a language that lacked written creative literature, the stories from the Bible became the major literary works. The metaphor and idiom that the translation used came very handy for those who wished to write personal and official communications in Ao Naga. The language is endowed with very many literary and language forms and functions. The translation gave several models for the textbooks to be used. The benefits of the translation are boundless in time and space for the Ao Naga people. The need for a revision in the form of a common language was needed and this too through the Bible Society of India the Ao Naga Bible (CL) was published in the year 2004.</p> <p>This translation, published by the Bible Society of India, was published in 2004.
