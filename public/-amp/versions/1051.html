<h1>NIEMNYAN (NOKT)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>Nocte Naga</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p>The Nokte, (literally, village people) is a Naga tribe having a population of 50,485 (as per 2001 Census of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh, Tirap District, Khonsa) are found in the Patkai hills of Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh, a state in the Northeast of India. They belong to the family of Tibeto-Burman language group. As per the statistical office Khonsa, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, the literacy rate of Noktes is 54.74. Initially, the Noktes were followers of Theravada Buddhism and Animism. Besides, due to their long and traditional contact with the people of the neighbouring plains, they adopted Hinduism too. For the last couple of years the Baptist missionaries are operating mission work among these people. They started receiving the Gospel positively. As a result, the christian population is increasing significantly. It is estimated that there are now around 9,000 christians. With this spectacular numerical growth of Christians it becomes difficult to nurture the young churches without the scripture in their own language. As a trial the BSI provided some selections in their language of which the outcome was outstanding. With this achievement the Bible Society with a request from the churches initiated the New Testament translation for the first time with a view that this venture will enhance in winning many souls to Christ and to nurture young churches as well. Nokte New Testament was published in 2010 by the Bible Society of India,</p> <p>If you are interested in obtaining a printed copy, please contact the Bible Society of India at www.bsind.org</p>
