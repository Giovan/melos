<h1>New Living Translation (NLT)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>English</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<h3>About this Title</h3> <p>The goal of any Bible translation is to convey the meaning of the ancient Hebrew and Greek texts as accurately as possible to the modern reader. The New Living Translation is based on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation. The challenge for the translators was to create a text that would make the same impact in the life of modern readers that the original text had for the original readers. In the New Living Translation, this is accomplished by translating entire thoughts (rather than just words) into natural, everyday English. The end result is a translation that is easy to read and understand and that accurately communicates the meaning of the original text.</p> <h3>Copyright Information</h3> <p>The text of the <em>Holy Bible</em>, New Living Translation, may be quoted in any form (written, visual, electronic, or audio) up to and inclusive of five hundred (500) verses without express written permission of the publisher, provided that the verses quoted do not account for more than 25 percent of the work in which they are quoted, and provided that a complete book of the Bible is not quoted.</p> <p>When the <em>Holy Bible</em>, New Living Translation, is quoted, one of the following credit lines must appear on the copyright page or title page of the work:</p> <p>Scripture quotations marked NLT are taken from the <em>Holy Bible</em>, New Living Translation, copyright 1996, 2004, 2007 by Tyndale House Foundation.
