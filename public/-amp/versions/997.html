<h1>BAIBEL KANGTHIR (KARB)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>Karbi</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p>The Karbis, the predominant tribe are mainly concentrated in Karbi Anglong District situated in the Central part of Assam; their population is estimated to be more than 2 lakhs. Although at present, they are found to inhabit the Karbi Anglong District, nevertheless some Karbis are found in the pockets of North Cachar Hills, Kamrup, Morigaon, Nagoan and Sonitpur Districts in Assam. They are also called as ‘Mikir’ by people other than its own community even though since time immemorial this tribe identified themselves as ‘Karbi”. Racially the Karbis belong to the Mongoloid group and linguistically they belong to the Tibeto-Burman Group. They speak both Assamese language and the Karbi dialect as well. In fact, due to the poor literacy rate they used Assamesse language for many decades. However, the trend is changing with the mission schools run by the Roman Catholics, the Presbyterian, the Baptists and the efforts from their own Autonomous Council, there is a significant improvement in the field of Education. The Assamese Script is replaced by the Roman Script which is consciously accepted by the Karbis. The growth of the Christians population among the Karbis is encouraging unlike some decades ago. The Bible Society seeing the need of the growing Churches published the New Testament in 1993. This has resulted a tremendous impact upon the Churches. However even today the ratio of Christian population is much lower than the Hindu Karbis and the traditional adherents. Therefore, this Project is undertaken with a view to intensify the growth of Evangelism among the non-Christians and the nurture the growing Church effectively as well.The New Testament was published in 1993 and the Karbi Holy Bible in 2010.</p> <p>This translation, published by the Bible Society of India, was published in 2010.</p> <p>If you are interested in obtaining a printed copy, please contact the Bible Society of India at www.bsind.org</p>
