<h2 class='version'>Inuktitut - Inuktitut: Eastern Arctic</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<h1>Eastern Artic Inuktitut Bible</h1> <h3>About Inuktitut</h3> <p>Inuktitut, also called Eastern Arctic Inuktitut, is spoken primarily in Nunavut and in Nunavik (northern Quebec) by the Inuit people. It is one of the official languages in the Nunavut territory along with English. The writing system used in Inuktitut is based on the syllabic writing originally developed by James Evans for Cree speakers, which was later adapted and introduced to the Inuit by Edmund Peck.</p> <h3>About This Translation</h3> <p>The Canadian Bible Society partnered closely with the Anglican Church diocese of the Arctic on the production of this scripture translation. The translation project was established by Dr. Eugene Nida, Translation Director for the American Bible Society in 1978 at the invitation of the Anglican Church. It is the first complete Bible translated in Canada where all of the translation has been done by speakers of the language (all Anglican priests, two of whom were consecrated as Bishops during the course of their work on the translation). The New Testament was first published in print in 1992, with at least 5 subsequent reprints. The complete Bible was published in 2012 and dedicated in the new Cathedral in Iqaluit on June 3, 2012. If you are interested in obtaining a printed copy of this Bible, please contact the Canadian Bible Society at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biblescanada.com">http://www.biblescanada.com</a>.</p> <h3>Copyright Information</h3> <p>Eastern Arctic Inuktitut Bible © 2012 Canadian Bible Society</p> <p>The text of the Bible in Inuktitut which appears in this electronic format or website is for personal use only.</p> <p>Up to five hundred (500) verses of the Bible text in any form (written, visual, electronic or audio) may be quoted without permission.
