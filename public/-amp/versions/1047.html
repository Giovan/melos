<h1>St Paul from the Trenches 1916 (GWC)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>English</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p>About this Version</p> <p>Gerald Warre-Cornish was born in 1874 at Eton, the son of Francis Warre Cornish, the Vice-Provost of Eton College. Gerald had qualified for a double first in the Classical Tripos at Cambridge University. He worked as a lecturer in Ancient Greek at Manchester University. When the First World War started he joined the British Army and achieved the rank of Major in the 6th Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry.</p> <p>He was killed in action on September 16, 1916, aged 41 at Flers, whilst gallantly leading his company in the successful attack on the enemy. On his body was found a small mud-strained copybook containing his unfinished translation of St Paul’s epistles. He is buried at Thiepval at the Somme in France. His work was first published in 1937 as “St Paul from the Trenches” and it was reprinted several times upto 1948. In the preface John Sidney Brathwaite wrote that “No-one after reading this will be disposed to doubt the amount of thought and care that went to this very original rendering of the three Epistles.”</p> <p>These Trench Epistles were digitised for the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2014.
