<h1>AMÜSA BAIBEL (NAGS)</h1>
<h2 class='version'>Sangtam Naga</h2>
<div class='copyright'>
<p>The Sangtams inhabit the South-eastern part of the Tuensang district of Nagaland having a population of 42,886 (2001 Census). They belong to the language of Tibeto-Burman family. With the help of American Baptist Missionaries and neighbouring tribes they received the Gospel sometime in the early part of 20th century. Like other Naga tribes, when they received the Gospel, head hunting was still practiced. Because of lethargy of fear the spread of Christianity was a bit slow. However, after two decades, believers increased gradually, but there was no leadership during those days because there were only few literates. Majority of the people could not read or write. Because of such problems and difficulties, they decided to join the Ao Baptist Churches Association (ABAM) which was the most advanced and well organized association. This lasted for more than 27 years. But with the improvement of literacy rate and able leadership, they formed their own association in 1946. The forming of new association enhanced the literacy too as education along with evangelism were given main priority. This new initiative proved to be the vital force in winning many souls to Christ. Today almost the whole Sangtam tribe are Christians. Initially the Bible Society had published some portions of the Bible some decade ago and subsequently the Sangtam Naga Bible was published in 1995. It is noteworthy that the Sangtam Bible was considered to be the first book of literature and grammar for the Sangtams. This indicates that the scripture can serve as normative both for spiritual growth and literature development as well.</p> <p>This translation, published by the Bible Society of India, was published in 1995.</p> <p>If you are interested in obtaining a printed copy, please contact the Bible Society of India at www.bsind.org</p>
