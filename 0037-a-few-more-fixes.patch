+      was <em>The Message<\/em> written? The best answer to that question comes from
+      Eugene Peterson himself: \"While I was teaching a class on Galatians, I began
+      to realize that the adults in my class weren''t feeling the vitality and directness
+      that I sensed as I read and studied the New Testament in its original Greek.
+      Writing straight from the original text, I began to attempt to bring into English
+      the rhythms and idioms of the original language. I knew that the early readers
+      of the New Testament were captured and engaged by these writings and I wanted
+      my congregation to be impacted in the same way. I hoped to bring the New Testament
+      to life for two different types of people: those who hadn''t read the Bible
+      because it seemed too distant and irrelevant and those who had read the Bible
+      so much that it had become ''old hat.''\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Peterson''s parishioners
+      simply weren''t connecting with the real meaning of the words and the relevance
+      of the New Testament for their own lives. So he began to bring into English
+      the rhythms and idioms of the original ancient Greek&#151;writing straight out
+      of the Greek text without looking at other English translations. As he shared
+      his version of Galatians with them, they quit stirring their coffee and started
+      catching Paul''s passion and excitement as he wrote to a group of Christians
+      whom he was guiding in the ways of Jesus Christ. For more than two years, Peterson
+      devoted all his efforts to <em>The Message New Testament<\/em>. His primary
+      goal was to capture the tone of the text and the original conversational feel
+      of the Greek, in contemporary English.<\/p>\n\n<p>Language changes. New words
+      are formed. Old words take on new meaning. There is a need in every generation
+      to keep the language of the gospel message current, fresh, and understandable&#151;the
+      way it was for its very first readers. That is what <em>The Message<\/em> seeks
+      to accomplish for contemporary readers. It is a version for our time&#151;designed
+      to be read by contemporary people in the same way as the original <em> koine<\/em>
+      Greek and Hebrew manuscripts were savored by people thousands of years ago.
+      <\/p>\n\n<p>That''s why NavPress felt the time was right for a new version.
+      When we hear something over and over again in the same way, we can become so
+      familiar with it that the text loses its impact. The Message strives to help
+      readers hear the living Word of God&#151;the Bible&#151;in a way that engages
+      and intrigues us right where we are. <br><br>\n\n<p>Some people like to read
+      the Bible in Elizabethan English. Others want to read a version that gives a
+      close word-for-word correspondence between the original languages and English.
+      Eugene Peterson recognized that the original sentence structure is very different
+      from that of contemporary English. He decided to strive for the spirit of the
+      original manuscripts&#151;to express the rhythm of the voices, the flavor of
+      the idiomatic expressions, the subtle connotations of meaning that are often
+      lost in English translations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of <em>The Message<\/em> is
+      to engage people in the reading process and help them understand what they read.
+      This is not a study Bible, but rather \"a reading Bible.\" The verse numbers,
+      which are not in the original documents, have been left out of the print version
+      to facilitate easy and enjoyable reading. The original books of the Bible were
+      not written in formal language. <em>The Message<\/em> tries to recapture the
+      Word in the words we use today. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Copyright Information<\/h3>\n\n<p><em>The

-      was <em>The Message<\/em> written? The best answer to that question comes from
-      Eugene Peterson himself: \"While I was teaching a class on Galatians, I began
-      to realize that the adults in my class weren''t feeling the vitality and directness
-      that I sensed as I read and studied the New Testament in its original Greek.
-      Writing straight from the original text, I began to attempt to bring into English
-      the rhythms and idioms of the original language. I knew that the early readers
-      of the New Testament were captured and engaged by these writings and I wanted
-      my congregation to be impacted in the same way. I hoped to bring the New Testament
-      to life for two different types of people: those who hadn''t read the Bible
-      because it seemed too distant and irrelevant and those who had read the Bible
-      so much that it had become ''old hat.''\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Peterson''s parishioners
-      simply weren''t connecting with the real meaning of the words and the relevance
-      of the New Testament for their own lives. So he began to bring into English
-      the rhythms and idioms of the original ancient Greek&#151;writing straight out
-      of the Greek text without looking at other English translations. As he shared
-      his version of Galatians with them, they quit stirring their coffee and started
-      catching Paul''s passion and excitement as he wrote to a group of Christians
-      whom he was guiding in the ways of Jesus Christ. For more than two years, Peterson
-      devoted all his efforts to <em>The Message New Testament<\/em>. His primary
-      goal was to capture the tone of the text and the original conversational feel
-      of the Greek, in contemporary English.<\/p>\n\n<p>Language changes. New words
-      are formed. Old words take on new meaning. There is a need in every generation
-      to keep the language of the gospel message current, fresh, and understandable&#151;the
-      way it was for its very first readers. That is what <em>The Message<\/em> seeks
-      to accomplish for contemporary readers. It is a version for our time&#151;designed
-      to be read by contemporary people in the same way as the original <em> koine<\/em>
-      Greek and Hebrew manuscripts were savored by people thousands of years ago.
-      <\/p>\n\n<p>That''s why NavPress felt the time was right for a new version.
-      When we hear something over and over again in the same way, we can become so
-      familiar with it that the text loses its impact. The Message strives to help
-      readers hear the living Word of God&#151;the Bible&#151;in a way that engages
-      and intrigues us right where we are. <br><br>\n\n<p>Some people like to read
-      the Bible in Elizabethan English. Others want to read a version that gives a
-      close word-for-word correspondence between the original languages and English.
-      Eugene Peterson recognized that the original sentence structure is very different
-      from that of contemporary English. He decided to strive for the spirit of the
-      original manuscripts&#151;to express the rhythm of the voices, the flavor of
-      the idiomatic expressions, the subtle connotations of meaning that are often
-      lost in English translations.<\/p>\n\n<p>The goal of <em>The Message<\/em> is
-      to engage people in the reading process and help them understand what they read.
-      This is not a study Bible, but rather \"a reading Bible.\" The verse numbers,
-      which are not in the original documents, have been left out of the print version
-      to facilitate easy and enjoyable reading. The original books of the Bible were
-      not written in formal language. <em>The Message<\/em> tries to recapture the
-      Word in the words we use today. <\/p>\n\n<h3>Copyright Information<\/h3>\n\n<p><em>The
